## **Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application**  

A **fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game** where two players can take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3×3 grid. The game automatically detects wins, draws, and allows players to restart after each round.  

### **Features**  

- **Two-Player Mode** – Play against a friend in real-time.  
- **Turn Indicator** – Displays whose turn it is.  
- **Win Detection** – Highlights the winning combination when a player wins.  
- **Draw Detection** – Detects if all cells are filled without a winner.  
- **Restart Button** – Allows players to reset the game easily.  
- **Responsive Design** – Works across different screen sizes.  

### **Technologies Used**  

- **HTML** – Provides the structure for the game board and UI elements.  
- **CSS** – Styles the game board, buttons, and animations.  
- **JavaScript** – Handles game logic, event listeners, and win conditions.  

### **How to Play**  

1. **Players take turns** clicking on the grid to place "X" or "O".  
2. The game **checks for a winner** after every move.  
3. If a player wins, the winning row/column/diagonal is **highlighted**, and a message displays the winner.  
4. If the board fills up without a winner, it declares a **Draw**.  
5. Click **"Play Again"** to restart the game.  


### **Future Enhancements**  

- Add an **AI opponent** for single-player mode.  
- Implement **local storage** to keep track of scores.  
- Improve UI animations for a more interactive experience.
